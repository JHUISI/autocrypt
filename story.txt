We are interested in a model where a server for example wants it's
clients to use a more efficient scheme.  We are not addressing cases
where the server intensionally gives the client a faulty/insecure
scheme.  For this reason, schemes should only be trusted for the
server that provided them.  If the server gives us a malicious scheme,
which we use for comm. with that server, it doesn't matter because
tehy could give us evil data anyway and can give all of our data to
anyone they want.
