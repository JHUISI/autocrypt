define architecture for rooting proofs in something already believed on the machine (assumptions)

translate schemes (SDL) to security definitions in easycrypt or check that scheme in easycrypt corresponds to SDL

write code that verifies that a provided proof does refine to violating an assumption

check that proof correctly connects the pieces (require the proof to have a claim at the end?)


In the end, what we really need is a proof checker.

Input:
proof
SDL scheme
assumption
metadata (an identifier for the assumption, the security definition used)

Output:
boolean, good proof or not
