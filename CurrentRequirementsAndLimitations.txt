-- We can only handle signature schemes in which the signature is one element.

-- The public key must be assigned a group element somewhere in the KeyGen function.

-- The output variable of the sign function should be one variable name, nothing else (i.e., it cannot be
an expression).  This is b/c we have to automatically infer the type of the output of the sign function,
so we need some variable to analyze.

-- All hashes performed in the signature function must hash to the same group (i.e., you cannot have one
variable hashing to G1 and another hashing to G2).

-- For any function that is passed to the adversary (which is all functions except keygen, setup, and 
verify), the output must be one variable name, nothing else.  This is b/c we have to automatically infer
the type of the output of each function, so we need some variable to analyze.

-- All calculations must be one calculation per line.  For example, you cannot have the following:

x := H(M, G1) ^ y

It needs to be converted to the following:

x := H(M, G1)
z := x ^ y

Future work is to detect when a violation of this occurs, and future future work is to correct the 
problem automatically.
